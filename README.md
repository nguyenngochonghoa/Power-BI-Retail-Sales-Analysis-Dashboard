# Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing retail sales performance.  
The dashboard helps stakeholders monitor business KPIs, identify sales trends, and evaluate product performance across multiple dimensions such as time, region, channel, category, and manufacturer.

The dashboard is structured into three pages for different levels of analysis:  

- **Overview** â†’ Business-wide KPIs and trends  
- **Product Analysis** â†’ Performance across categories, segments, sold/unsold status  
- **Product Details** â†’ In-depth product-level insights

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
In a competitive retail environment, businesses need more than just raw transactional data. They require a centralized and visualized reporting system to answer key questions such as:  

- How are revenue and sales units performing over time?  
- Which regions, channels, and manufacturers drive the most growth?  
- Which products are top sellers, and which remain unsold?  
- What is the performance of different categories and segments?  
- How can managers make informed decisions to optimize product portfolio and sales strategy?  

This dashboard bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights, enabling better decision-making for managers and product teams.
